# Console Banking System Management Program Using C++

## Few things to say about this project
First of all this is academic project, made using modern C++17 and above. In this project I practiced working with functions, OOP and lots of C++ staf. Some functions connected with money are not working properly, that means this project should be finished

## Following Program Allows You To Do :
1.ACCOUNT REGISTRATION
2.DEPOSIT MONEY
3.WITHDRAW MONEY
4.TRANSFER MONEY
5.MODIFY ACCOUNT
6.VIEW A ACCOUNT
7.CLOSE AN ACCOUNT
8.VIEW ALL ACCOUNTS(ADMIN)

## Future of this project
I want to remake project from console application to GUI, probably this will be QT Framework.
